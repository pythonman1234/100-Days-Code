 In C++, a stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It's like a stack of plates where you can only access the topmost plate. Here are some key details about stacks in C++:

1. Implementation: You can implement a stack using either an array or a linked list. The Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ provides a stack container class that you can use.

2. Operations: The stack supports the following operations:
   - push(item): Adds an item to the top of the stack.
   - pop(): Removes and returns the topmost item from the stack.
   - top(): Returns the value of the topmost item without removing it.
   - empty(): Checks whether the stack is empty.
   - size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.

3. Limitations: The stack has a fixed size, which means it can overflow if you try to add more elements than its capacity. Make sure to handle stack overflow errors carefully.

Stacks are commonly used in solving problems involving function calls, expression evaluation, backtrack algorithms, and more. Let me know if you need more information or if there's anything else I can help you with!
