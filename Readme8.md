The master theorem is a way to analyze the time complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms using recursion. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. First, we identify the form of the recursion. It usually takes the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), where a is the number of subproblems, n/b is the size of each subproblem, and f(n) is the time spent on the work outside the recursion.

2. Next, we compare f(n) with a function called n^log_b(a). There are three cases:
   - If f(n) is smaller than n^log_b(a), then the time complexity is dominated by the work inside the recursion, and the overall complexity is O(n^log_b(a)).
   - If f(n) is equal to n^log_b(a), then the overall complexity is O(n^log_b(a) * log n).
   - If f(n) is larger than n^log_b(a), then the time complexity is dominated by f(n), and the overall complexity is O(f(n)).

3. Finally, we solve any recurrence relations to determine the actual time complexity.
