In C++, a stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It means that the last item added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. On the other hand, a queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first item added will be the first one to be removed. 

For example, imagine you have a stack of books. If you add a new book, it will go on top of the stack. When you want to remove a book, you will take the one from the top. This is how a stack works. 

In contrast, a queue is like a line of people waiting for a bus. The first person to arrive will be the first one to get on the bus. Similarly, the first item added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

Both stacks and queues have their own uses depending on the problem you are trying to solve in programming.
