 When it comes to choosing the best data structure in C++ based on time complexity, it depends on the specific operation you want to perform.

Here are a few commonly used data structures and their typical time complexities for common operations:

1. Arrays:
   - Access: O(1)
   - Search: O(n)
   - Insertion/Deletion at ends: O(1)
   - Insertion/Deletion in the middle: O(n)

2. Linked Lists:
   - Access: O(n)
   - Search: O(n)
   - Insertion/Deletion at ends: O(1)
   - Insertion/Deletion in the middle: O(n)

3. Stacks:
   - Access: O(n)
   - Search: O(n)
   - Insertion/Deletion: O(1) at the top (LIFO principle)

4. Queues:
   - Access: O(n)
   - Search: O(n)
   - Insertion/Deletion: O(1) at the ends (FIFO principle)

5. Binary Search Trees (BSTs):
   - Access/Search/Insertion/Deletion: Average O(log n), Worst-case O(n)

6. Hash Tables (unordered_map):
   - Access/Search/Insertion/Deletion: O(1) on average, Worst-case O(n)

It's important to note that these time complexities are general guidelines and may vary based on factors such as the specific implementation, size of the data set, and the workload.

Choosing the right data structure involves considering the specific requirements of your use case and the trade-offs between time complexity, memory usage, and other factors.
