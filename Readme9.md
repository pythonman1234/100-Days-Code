 Here are the most common stack functions:

1. Push: This function is used to add an element to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: This function is used to remove the top element from the stack.
3. Peek: This function is used to view the value of the top element without removing it from the stack.
4. isEmpty: This function checks if the stack is empty or not.
5. isFull: This function checks if the stack is full or not (in case of a fixed-size stack).

These functions help in managing and manipulating the stack data structure.
