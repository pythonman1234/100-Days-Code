space complexity 

1. Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by a program to run based on the input size.

2. Similar to time complexity, space complexity is also denoted using Big O notation like O(1), O(n), or O(n^2).

3. O(1) represents constant space complexity, meaning the amount of memory used by the program remains constant regardless of the input size.

4. O(n) represents linear space complexity, where the amount of memory used increases linearly with the input size.

5. O(n^2) represents quadratic space complexity, where the amount of memory used increases exponentially with the input size.

6. It's important to analyze the data structures and variables used in your code to determine the space complexity. This helps in understanding how much memory your code will require to process larger inputs.

7. Optimizing space complexity can be beneficial for efficient memory usage, especially when dealing with large data
