 Here are some points on why linked lists can be better than arrays:

- Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically, allowing for more flexibility compared to arrays with fixed sizes.
- Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Linked lists excel at inserting and deleting elements, especially in the middle of the list. This is because they only require adjusting a few pointers, whereas arrays may need elements to be shifted, resulting in higher time complexity.
- Recursive Implementation: Linked lists are easily implemented recursively, which can simplify certain algorithms and make them more intuitive to understand.

These are just a few reasons why linked lists have advantages over arrays!
