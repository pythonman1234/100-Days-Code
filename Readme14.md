Binary trees in C++ step by step with an example.

A binary tree is a data structure where each node can have at most two child nodes: a left child and a right child. Think of it like a tree where each node branches out into two more nodes.

Here's an example:

Let's say we want to create a binary tree to store numbers. We start with a root node, which is the topmost node in the tree. In this example, let's make the root node hold the number 10.

1. We create the root node with the value 10.
2. We can then add nodes to the left and right of the root node. Let's add the number 5 to the left and 15 to the right.
3. Now, we can further expand the tree by adding nodes to the left and right of the existing nodes. Let's add 3 and 7 to the left of 5, and 12 and 20 to the right of 15.
4. We can keep expanding the tree by adding nodes in a similar manner.

The binary tree would look like this:

         10
        /  \
       5    15
      / \   / \
     3   7  12  20

Each node in the tree has a value and can have up to two child nodes. The left child is always smaller than the parent, and the right child is always larger.

Binary trees are commonly used for efficient searching and sorting algorithms. They allow for quick access and manipulation of dat
