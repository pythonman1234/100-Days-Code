n most programming languages, when you declare an array with a fixed size, the memory for that array is typically allocated either on the stack or the heap. However, the specifics can vary depending on the language and the context.

Let's consider languages like C and C++, which allow you to create static arrays on the stack. In these languages, the stack is a region of memory that is used for storing local variables and function call information. When you declare an array as a local variable, and the size of the array is known at compile time, the compiler can allocate memory for that array on the stack.
